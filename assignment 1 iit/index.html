The seed of interest in this kind of things was implanted in my early childhood.<br>As my father is from technical background, in my childhood itself my father used to tell me interesting things related to tech such as mobile phones, web browsing and much more. All these things fascinated me and gradually I started taking interest in all that. There was an exponential growth of my interest in information technology when I was 11 years old and attended a workshop related to how tech giants work, how they earn profit, how they collect our data such as personal information, banking details and much more . In higher classes too I opted for computer science as an optional subject to know more and more about different software. Furthermore, in lockdown amid covid pandemic, I applied for a course which taught basics of programming in python.<br>After completion of my higher secondary education, I decided to study outside my home country and continue my further education in Australia. So, I started looking for universities in Australia and during my research I came to know about RMIT. RMIT have lots of positive reviews on the internet and it is one the most globally reputed university. Also, RMIT has numerous student centric facilities which also attracted me apart from supremely skilled professors who are always ready to help students.<br>During my studies, I expect to learn a complete computer language that is python which would help me in my professional career. Also, with my enrolled subjects I would expect to learn to create intricate software which would finally enhance end user experience. In addition to that, during my learning, there would be drastic improvement in my communication skills with help of group assignments.</p>
